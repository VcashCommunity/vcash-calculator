[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/85871003b9fe40b084a9adb84404b23d)](https://www.codacy.com/app/sum01/vcash-calculator?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=sum01/vcash-calculator&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

A simple calculator that takes some input and calculates your estimated profit, average mined, and power cost for each day/week/month/year.

All pricing info is pulled from the [public Bittrex API](https://www.bittrex.com/Home/Api), and network information is pulled from [xCore's Vcash explorer API.](https://explorer.vcash.info/info)

Note: The current network hashrate can change quickly, and calculations depend on it, so results may vary.

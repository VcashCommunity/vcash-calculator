## General

[snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) variable/function naming
is used.\
Javascript ES6 is used (so `let` and `const` are valid).\
This uses Bootstrap v4, which is currently in beta. When it's released, it
should be updated and checked for breakage.\
All API calls are made from the browser via the `main.js` file. The [cors-anywhere proxy](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)
makes this possible.

## Beautifier & Spacing

[JS Beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify) is used to beautify
the HTML and JS, and 2-space spacing is used.\
Make sure to use Unix line endings (a carrige return at the end of the file).
